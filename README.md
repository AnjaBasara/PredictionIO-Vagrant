Bring Up PredictionIO 0.8.0 VM with Vagrant
===========================================

Vagrant is an open source tool for simplifying the download and setup steps of
a virtual machine (VM) with VirtualBox. It is recommended for a quick
PredictionIO installation in a testing or development environment, as it will
save you from many of the common pitfalls of the installation process.

Please refer to our
