Bring Up PredictionIO 0.8.0 VM with Vagrant
===========================================

Vagrant is an open source tool for simplifying the download and setup steps of
a virtual machine (VM) with VirtualBox. It is recommended for a quick
PredictionIO installation in a testing or development environment, as it will
save you from many of the common pitfalls of the installation process.

Please refer to the
[documentation site](http://docs.prediction.io/current/)
for detailed usage and setup.

Installation
============
1. ```git clone git@github.com:magento-hackathon/PredictionIO-Vagrant.git```
2. ```cd PredictionIO-Vagrant```
3. ```vagrant up```
4. Follow the in-console instructions

- PredictionIO runs on port 7070
- Instances run on port 8000

Optional: Switch to branch `8.1-SNAPSHOT` to use the most recent snapshot version of PredictionIO 0.8.1 directly from github instead of the stable 0.8.0 version.
